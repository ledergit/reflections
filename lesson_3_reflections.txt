When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Offsite backup. Also, if you are working from more than one computer, this allows easy sharing between computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may want to be working with a particular version, so you wouldn't want to automatically update your files if you weren't ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is a github command that allows you to copy a repo directly on github. Clone lets you copy a repo either locally or from github. And branch works inside of a repo and lets you create different versions within the same repo.
